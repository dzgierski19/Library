Prepare an abstraction for a library and book lending system. A customer can borrow more than one book from the library. Functionalities to be implemented include:

Adding and removing books from the list of borrowed books.
Return - if it occurs on time, there is no penalty; if not, each day of delay incurs penalty points - when the penalty points reach 10, borrowing books is not allowed for a month, after which the points reset.
Adding books to the list.
Removing books from the list.
Borrowing book(s) for a specific user.
Returning the borrowed book(s).
